# AimThing (Standalone Builder)

This is the standalone version builder, which will just grab the original code and build executables from it, using Tauri.  

Builds can be found in the Releases section or the Actions tab.  
Find the game's actual source code [here](https://github.com/Lukiiy/Aimthing).
